            <p>Proving that burgers can be healthy, our patties are loaded with nutrients and a perfect balance of protein and carbs. There's 13g fibre to help with digestion, and 18g protein to aid muscle recovery and repair. And while all the ingredients are great in their own way, the star of the show is beetroot, a veg that's low in calories, high in vitamins and minerals and has been shown to provide various health benefits from supporting heart health to lowering blood pressure!
                Healthy and delicious, this burger recipe makes 6 servings and is really easy to prepare. You’ll want to prepare your burgers the day before as they’ll need up to 24 hours to set in the fridge, but once they’re set you can cook them up in just 4-6 minutes – the perfect prep for when you’ve got a busy evening in store!
