            <p>We’ve combined oats, honey, peanut butter, berries, and Greek yoghurt for a refreshing creamy yoghurt cup. Each serving is just 200 calories, with plenty of protein from the Greek yoghurt and slow-release carbs and fibre from the oats and berries and to keep you going until your next meal.
                Using frozen fruit can actually improve the vitamin content, as freezing stops the vitamins and minerals from degrading. Frozen fruit is often cheaper too – each portion is just 38p! We’ve gone with blueberries and raspberries, but feel free to mix these up.
